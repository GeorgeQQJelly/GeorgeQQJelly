### What's down (outerspace)? I'm George!
🪐 A creative interested in building everything cool under the sun (this does not include physical houses, unfortunately).

🌱 I'm currently learning CSS and Javascript frameworks, including Tailwind and Vue.js! I am also tackling the Unity game 
engine, python, and funky designs.

⚡ Some of my hobibes include writing, shredding the guitar, daydreaming, digital art, and composing!

💬 Ask me anything about your crazy project idea! The craziest impossible-est ideas are the most fun. 

📫 You can reach out to me at datta.td.d@gmail.com!
